# dbgtools

dbgtools is a GDB and pwndbg extension. It aims to remove friction and repetition from binary exploitation and reverse engineering.

Main use cases include:
* Scripting gdb from pwntools
* Flexible tracing of a whole binary execution with gdb
* Various commands that make common exploitation steps quicker

See `examples/` for how this and more might look like

## Installation
Right now, just:
* Clone the repo somewhere
* Install `requirements.txt`
* Add the line `source /<somewhere>/gdbinit.py` after loading pwndbg
